# financial_data_web_app
A web app that allows a user to upload financial data  

NB. Code:  
-  does not handle a lot of errors that may arise  
- does not create new users  
- does not handle duplication
- uses a local database (does not do a mysqldump, which helps with transfering data between 'hosts' without moving the database itself)
